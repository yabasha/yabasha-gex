# Product Requirements Document: GEX, A Dependency Auditing and Documentation Tool

**1.0 Executive Summary**

This document outlines the product requirements for GEX (Global/local Extract), a novel Command Line Interface (CLI) tool designed to address critical challenges in Node.js dependency management. GEX is conceived as a focused utility that programmatically interacts with the `npm` ecosystem to generate structured, reproducible reports of installed packages. By providing a unified, context-aware interface, GEX will allow developers to extract and document package names, versions, and metadata from both their global system environments and local projects. The tool's core value proposition lies in its ability to generate these reports in both human-readable Markdown and machine-readable JSON formats, thereby filling a distinct market gap for dedicated environmental auditing and documentation. GEX is positioned not as a replacement for existing security or visualization tools, but as a complementary, foundational utility that promotes environmental consistency and transparency throughout the development lifecycle.

**2.0 Problem Statement and Market Opportunity**

This section analyzes the core challenges developers face with Node.js dependency management and articulates the specific market need that GEX will satisfy. The widespread adoption of npm as a package manager has introduced significant complexity, creating a clear need for purpose-built tools that go beyond the basic functionality of the native `npm` CLI.

**2.1 The Challenge of Dependency Management in the Modern Development Lifecycle**

Modern development is plagued by several recurring issues related to dependency management. One primary challenge is the prevalence of inconsistent development environments. Developers frequently encounter discrepancies between locally installed project dependencies and the global packages that reside on their systems.1 This can lead to the classic "works on my machine" scenario, where a project's behavior is influenced by system-wide CLI tools or libraries that are not explicitly defined in its
`package.json` file. This lack of explicit, documented dependencies can lead to unexpected build failures and obscure bugs when a project is moved to a new machine or a CI/CD environment.
Furthermore, the interconnected and transitive nature of npm packages gives rise to a phenomenon colloquially known as "dependency hell," where version mismatches can cause runtime errors and integration issues.5 The
`npm ls` command can provide some insight into this issue, for example by indicating when a package has been "deduped" to meet multiple version requirements, but the raw output can be difficult to parse and use for historical tracking.8 Manually listing and documenting these complex dependency trees is a time-consuming and error-prone process. The resulting documentation often becomes outdated as soon as a single package is updated, making it an unreliable source of truth for project handovers, audits, or technical debt analysis.

**2.2 Dependency Management as a Project Discipline**

A deeper examination of the problem reveals that dependency management is not merely a technical task but a core component of effective project discipline. Sources detailing general project management practices highlight the importance of "reviewing and updating dependencies periodically" and maintaining a "dependency log [that] records essential details".10 This framework can be applied to the context of Node.js projects, where the problem extends beyond simply identifying what is installed to the systematic tracking and auditing of those dependencies over the project's lifecycle. GEX, by its very design, can serve as the automated "dependency log" for a Node.js project, generating a persistent, versionable record of the environment at any given time.
The distinction between local and global package contexts is a critical aspect of this. While the `npm` CLI offers flags to view each context separately 2, there is no native command for a comprehensive, cross-context comparison. The need for a tool that can explicitly distinguish and audit these environments is a subtle but crucial requirement. For example, a developer may want to determine if a project is unintentionally relying on a global tool like
`eslint` that should be a `devDependency` listed in `package.json`. GEX will provide this capability, enabling a level of environmental scrutiny that is not easily achievable with standard `npm` commands. This capability positions the tool to not only document but also proactively enforce best practices for environmental consistency.

**3.0 Product Vision, Goals, and Success Metrics**

This section defines the purpose of GEX and outlines how its efficacy will be measured.

**3.1 Product Vision**

The vision for GEX is for it to become the de-facto CLI tool for developers to generate comprehensive, context-aware, and reproducible documentation of their Node.js package environments, fostering consistency and transparency across projects and teams.

**3.2 Product Goals**

The development and design of GEX will be guided by three core goals:
• **Simplicity:** The tool must be easy to install and use with intuitive commands that mirror existing `npm` conventions.
• **Clarity:** All generated output must be well-structured, clear, and immediately useful to both human readers and automated systems.
• **Accuracy:** All data must be extracted directly from the underlying `npm` system, ensuring that the reports are always up-to-date and reflect the true state of the environment.

**3.3 Success Metrics**

The success of GEX will be evaluated based on the following metrics:
• **Adoption Rate:** Achieve a target of a specific number of downloads on the npm registry within the first several months.
• **User Engagement:** A high volume of positive sentiment and stars on the project's GitHub repository will indicate that the tool effectively addresses a genuine developer need.
• **Performance:** The tool must generate a report for a project with a significant number of dependencies in a short and acceptable amount of time, ensuring that it can be seamlessly integrated into a developer's workflow.

**4.0 Core Functionality and User Stories**

This section details the specific features of GEX and maps them to the needs of its target users.

**4.1 Key Features and Command-Line Interface (CLI)**

The GEX CLI will be designed with a clear, logical command structure to support its primary functions.
• **Global Package Report:** A command will be provided to list all globally installed packages on a system. This feature directly addresses a core user request and will leverage the `npm ls --global` command for data extraction.2
• **Local Project Report:** A separate command will be used to analyze dependencies within a local project, with the capability to distinguish between `dependencies` and `devDependencies`.8 This functionality will utilize the standard
`npm ls` command, potentially with the `--omit=dev` flag to refine the output.9
• **Metadata Inclusion:** The generated reports will include project-level metadata such as `name`, `version`, and `description` to provide essential context and to identify the project being documented.13
• **Output Formats:** The tool will support multiple output formats, including Markdown (`.md`) for human readability and JSON (`.json`) for machine-readable use cases. This will require the use of dedicated Node.js libraries to format the extracted data into the desired output.

**4.2 User Stories**

The following user stories illustrate the value GEX will provide:
• **As a new team member,** a developer wants to generate a report of their local project's dependencies to quickly understand the project's architecture and avoid version conflicts.
• **As a DevOps engineer,** a professional wants to create a snapshot of all globally installed tools on a CI/CD server to ensure environmental consistency and prevent unexpected build failures.
• **As a project manager,** a leader wants a simple, structured report of a project's dependencies to track them as part of a formal "dependency log".11
• **As a technical lead,** a leader wants to identify and document outdated or vulnerable packages in a Markdown file to facilitate a project audit.

**5.0 Competitive Analysis**

This section positions GEX within the existing ecosystem of dependency management tools, highlighting its unique value proposition and how it complements other utilities.

**5.1 Analysis of Existing Tools**

The Node.js ecosystem is rich with tools that address various aspects of dependency management, but none serve the specific purpose of GEX.
• **`npm ls`:** This is the foundational command that GEX will leverage for data extraction. Its primary limitation is that its default tree-like output is difficult for a user to parse or use programmatically, unless the `--json` flag is utilized.9 It lacks built-in report generation capabilities.
• **`npm audit` and Snyk:** These tools are exclusively focused on security vulnerability scanning and remediation. They address a critical but different problem by identifying known vulnerabilities and providing remediation steps.14
• **`madge` and `dependency-cruiser`:** These are powerful tools for dependency visualization and rule-based validation.16 Their primary function is to analyze the relationships
_between modules_—such as finding circular dependencies—and not to provide a simple, comprehensive inventory of installed packages.

**5.2 GEX vs. The Competition: A Focus on Documentation and Auditing**

The primary distinction of GEX is that it occupies the niche of "documentation as a service." While other tools are designed for interactive analysis or automated security checks, GEX's primary purpose is to generate static, structured reports for human and machine consumption. It is not designed to find circular dependencies like `madge` or vulnerabilities like `snyk`, but rather to create a persistent, versionable record of the project's package environment. This core functionality allows GEX to function as a fundamental auditing tool for teams, enabling them to track environmental changes over time.
Instead of being a direct competitor, a more accurate characterization is that GEX is a complementary utility. A typical developer workflow might involve running `gex local` to document their project's dependency tree, followed by `npm audit` to check for security issues, and then perhaps `madge` to visualize module relationships. GEX provides the crucial initial step of creating a comprehensive inventory, which can then be used by other tools or integrated into a continuous documentation process. This complementary relationship is key to its adoption and market success.

**6.0 Technical Architecture and Implementation Plan**

This section outlines the proposed technical approach for building GEX, from data extraction to file generation.

**6.1 Core Architectural Components**

The architecture of GEX is modular, composed of four primary components:

1. **CLI Parser:** A standard library such as `commander.js` or `yargs` will be used to handle command-line arguments and options, providing a robust and familiar interface for users.
2. **Data Extractor:** This is the core of the tool. It will be responsible for programmatically invoking the `npm` CLI to retrieve the necessary package information.
3. **Report Generator:** This component will take the raw data extracted by the Data Extractor and format it into the specified Markdown and JSON outputs.
4. **File I/O:** Node.js's built-in `fs` module will be used to write the generated reports to the filesystem, supporting both synchronous and asynchronous operations.18

**6.2 Programmatic `npm` Access: A Deeper Analysis of Options**

The choice of how to programmatically access the `npm` CLI is a critical architectural decision. Two main approaches were considered:
• **Option 1: `child_process` (Recommended Approach)**
◦ This approach involves executing `npm ls --json` as a child process and capturing its standard output.20 The output, which is a JSON string, can then be parsed into a JavaScript object for processing. This method is considered the most reliable because it directly utilizes the official
`npm` toolchain installed on the user's system. This ensures compatibility with various `npm` versions and configurations, including those managed by version managers like `nvm`.3
• **Option 2: Using Libraries (`npm-programmatic`, `@npmcli/package-json`)**
◦ Libraries like `npm-programmatic` offer a wrapper for `npm` commands.22 However, a review of this library shows that it has not been updated in over six years, making it an unreliable choice for modern
`npm` versions and features.22 Another option,
`@npmcli/package-json`, is the official programmatic API for reading and updating `package.json` files.23 While valuable for its intended purpose, it does not provide the functionality to run
`npm ls` and retrieve the full dependency tree, including transitive dependencies.
Based on this analysis, the recommended approach is to use Node.js's `child_process` module to interact directly with the system's `npm` installation. This method provides the highest level of stability, reliability, and accuracy, which are fundamental requirements for GEX.

**6.3 Path Discovery for Global Packages**

A crucial technical detail for GEX is the ability to programmatically locate the global `node_modules` directory. A simple solution would be to hardcode common paths for different operating systems.3 However, this would be a brittle solution that would fail for users who use version managers like
`nvm` or have a custom npm configuration.
The most robust method for path discovery is to execute the `npm root -g` command, which returns the exact location of the global `node_modules` directory on the user's system.3 A deeper understanding of the
`npm` ecosystem reveals why this is the only reliable method. Node.js itself does not inherently know the location of these global modules; the path is a value that `npm` computes at runtime based on its specific configuration, which is stored in a file like `.npmrc`.24 The tool must therefore rely on
`npm` itself to provide this information, which further validates the decision to use the `child_process` approach for data extraction.

**7.0 Report Generation Specifications**

This section details the structure and content of the reports generated by GEX, ensuring they are both useful and consistent.

**7.1 JSON Output Schema**

The JSON output will be a structured representation of the extracted data. While the output of `npm ls --json` provides a rich, nested tree, it can be cumbersome to navigate.9 GEX will process and flatten this data into a simpler, more consumable format, especially for top-level dependencies, while preserving the full nested structure for deeper analysis if requested. The primary purpose of this output is to enable other tools and scripts to easily consume the data.

**7.2 Markdown Output Structure**

The Markdown report will be designed for maximum readability and clarity, following best practices for open-source project documentation.25
• **Header:** A clear, concise title derived from the project's `package.json` file will provide immediate context.
• **Project Metadata:** A dedicated section will present key information about the project, including its `name`, `version`, `description`, `homepage`, and `bugs` field.13
• **Global Packages:** A distinct section will list all globally installed packages, including their names and versions.
• **Local Dependencies:** A separate section will detail the project's local dependencies, with clear sub-sections for `dependencies` and `devDependencies`.8
• **Usage Notes:** The report will include a section on how the data can be used and a footer with a link to the GEX project page.25

**7.3 Table: Proposed GEX JSON Output Schema**

The following table defines the exact data structure for the machine-readable JSON output, ensuring it is predictable and easy for other tools to consume.JSON KeyData TypeDescription`report_version`StringThe version of the GEX tool that generated the report.`timestamp`StringThe time and date the report was generated (ISO 8601 format).`project_name`StringThe `name` field from the local project's `package.json`.`project_version`StringThe `version` field from the local project's `package.json`.`global_packages`Array of ObjectsA list of objects, each representing a globally installed package.`local_dependencies`Array of ObjectsA list of objects, each representing a regular project dependency.`local_dev_dependencies`Array of ObjectsA list of objects, each representing a development dependency.**Package Object Schema (for arrays above)**`name`StringThe name of the package.`version`StringThe installed version of the package.`resolved_path`StringThe full path to the package's installation directory.

**8.0 Future Roadmap and Enhancements**

The initial release of GEX will focus on core functionality. A phased approach is planned for future enhancements, expanding the tool's capabilities and market reach.
• **Phase 2:**
◦ **Security Vulnerability Integration:** Incorporate data from `npm audit` into GEX reports to provide a comprehensive security overview alongside package lists.14 This would allow GEX to fill both a documentation and a security auditing role.
◦ **Outdated Package Analysis:** Integrate functionality similar to `npm outdated` to flag dependencies that have newer versions available.7
◦ **Circular Dependency Detection:** While other tools excel here, a basic check for circular dependencies would enhance GEX's value as a general-purpose auditing tool.
• **Phase 3:**
◦ **CI/CD Integration:** Develop `gex-ci`, a version of the tool optimized for continuous integration and continuous delivery pipelines, to automatically generate and archive reports on every build.27
◦ **Multi-Ecosystem Support:** Expand support to other package managers like Yarn or pnpm to increase the tool's versatility.
◦ **HTML & Visual Reports:** Explore generating interactive HTML reports using libraries like D3.js to add a visual layer without overcomplicating the core tool.29 This would move GEX from a purely static report generator to a more interactive utility, paving the way for market expansion.
